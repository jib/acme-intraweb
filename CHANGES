version 1.01
Juerd pointed out that multiple 'use' of Acme::Intraweb would
result in multiple coderefs in @INC, so I added a check to
prevent that.
Also he pointed out that doing an 'eval "use $module"' would
potentially load it twice. So rather than having perl do a 'use'
for us, we now track down the module in @INC ourselves and hand
back the proper filehandle.
