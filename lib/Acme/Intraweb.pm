=head1 NAME

Acme::Intraweb

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::Intraweb;

    use Some::Module::Not::Yet::Installed


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Acme::Intraweb allows you to use modules not yet installed on your
system. Rather than throw annoying errors about "Could not locate
package Foo::Bar in @INC", Acme::Intraweb will just go to your
closest CPAN mirror and try to install the module for you, so your
program can go on its merry way.

=head1 USE

Make sure to mention 'use Acme::Intraweb' before any other module you
might not have, so it can have a chance to install it for you.

Everything else goes automatically.

=head1 BUGS

In code this funky, I'm sure there are some ;)

=head1 NOTE

This program requires (a configured version of) CPANPLUS to work.

=head1 BUG REPORTS
